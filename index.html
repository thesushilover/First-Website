                <p id="very_special">     Once upon a time there was a <span style="color:#00e5ee">very happy dragon</span>. He was also known as the Lucky dragon because obviously... da... why do you think he is called the lucky dragon. Anyways, the <span style="color:#ff00ff">very hapy dragon </span>was a very happy dragon, especially today. As the <span style="color:#ffd700">very happy dragon </span>was on his way to the liquor store to buy a million lottery tickets, he saw a candy store, he obviously walked in. After the <span style="color:purple">very happy dragon </span>had picked out a few very expensive candies, he bought them and then started to eat them. While he was eating his candy bars in his Corvet, a strange feeling came to him. His eyes began to itch, his nose began to itch, his ears began to itch, and then <span style="color:green">A</span><span style="color:blue">c</span><span style="color:red">h</span><span style="color:orange">oo!</span> his intestines flew out of his mouth, his stomach flew out of his mouth, his liver flew out of his mouth, and sadly... his heart flew out of his mouth. The end . </p>
